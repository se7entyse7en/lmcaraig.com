Hi! My name is Lou Marvin Caraig! I live in Florence, Italy with my beloved wife and six-year-old daughter. I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science with full marks and honor at the University of Florence in July 2013. I'm currently the **Engineering Team Lead at Athenian** where we're developing a data platform that enables to extract insights from source code and git hosting providers in order to improve teams' productivity.

I'm an avid learner and I need to feel that I'm improving every day. Currently, I'm self-learning from MOOCs and various online resources, and in the future, I'd like to also undertake a more structured learning path such as studying to earn a Master degree.

I'm mostly interested in **Data Engineering** and **Machine Learning**, and this is what I'll talk about the most. I love developing and contributing to open source projects

If you want to know more about me, here's the link to my [CV](https://www.visualcv.com/lou-marvin-caraig/).
